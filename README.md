# PCSS Mini-Project
This is the repository for the group MTA17337's mini-project in Programming for Complex Software Systems.

## Getting Started
This program is a multichat program, with multiple clients being able to connect to the same server.

To have different clients on more than one computer, you must first:
```
Step 1: Open Command Prompt on the computer where the server will be run
Step 2: Run the following command: ipconfig
Step 3: Find the IPv4 address
Step 4: Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IPv4 address in the server in line 41
Step 5: Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IPv4 address in the client in line 37
```
Note that you might have to find the IPv4 address a different way if you're not using Windows.

Open the server and wait for the message "Server is online" before trying to opening the clients.
