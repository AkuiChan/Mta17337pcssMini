This program is a multichat program, with multiple clients being able to connect under the same server.

To use the program you must first change the IP address in both the server and client to fit your network. This can be done in line 38 in the server, and line 31 in the client. You can find your IP address by clicking "properties" when looking at your wifi. Please look for the IPv4 address, since this program does not work with IPv6.

In order for the program to function correctly, you must first open the server and wait for the message "Server Online" before trying to open any of the clients.
